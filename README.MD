This is a TB detecting app made with fastai and the [Montgomery and Shenzhen TB datasets](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-publications/pubs/TuberculosisChestXrayImageDataSets.html)

The app isn't very accurate and is strictly not for diagnosis or treatment or making medical deicions

[The working app can be found here, served with voila and binder](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/aflip-tbornottb-piipw70u/voila/render/TB_or_not_TB.ipynb?token=JdX_LwudQFaa6GOuNneIuw)
